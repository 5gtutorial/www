Salient Features of 5G

With a huge array of innovative features, now your smart phone would be more parallel to the laptop. You can use broadband internet connection; other significant features that fascinate people are more gaming options, wider multimedia options, connectivity everywhere, zero latency, faster response time, and high quality sound and HD video can be transferred on other cell phone without compromising with the quality of audio and video.


[5G AND THE FABLE OF THE ELEPHANT - 5G Tutorial Innovate](https://www.martel-innovate.com/news/2019/08/26/5g-and-the-fable-of-the-elephant/)

> Remember the old fable of three blind people with the pachyderm? Each of them built an impression of the animal by touching it, and described quite different animals based on whether they felt the trunk, flank or tail. If 5G is that elephant, 5G Tutorial builds up an entire picture of 5G by working with all the parties involved in shaping it.
> 
> We work with innovators in start-ups, research centres and universities who are already looking at testing smart networks beyond 5G; we are partnering with mobile operators and infrastructure enablers currently deploying 5G and with SMEs developing applications and use cases for vertical industries; weâ€™re dialoguing with verticals striving to demonstrate how 5G can create profitable business cases.
> 
> 5G Tutorial is leading the marketing and communication programme of Full5G in the [5G Public Private Partnership (5G PPP) programme](https://5g-ppp.eu/). In this role we pivot the orchestration of technical, scientific and industry outputs of the 5G PPP projects, bringing to life the 5G vision of the European Commission.

> **Beyond the fable**
> 
> By combining our 5G know-how from a wide variety of perspectives, 5G Tutorial has developed an in-depth understanding of the opportunities and challenges ahead in the 5G arena.
> 
> 5G Tutorial is indeed working in partnership on several European Commission Horizon 2020 funded research and innovation projects, which gives our team the opportunity to work across several core technical areas:
> 
> -   [ORCA](http://orca-project.eu/) is developing multiple virtual networks.
> -   [FLAME](https://www.ict-flame.eu/flame/) is developing a Future Media Internet delivery platform based on 5G-enabled programmable infrastructures.
> -   [Fed4FIRE+](https://www.fed4fire.eu/) is offering facilities for testing 5G-based technologies and use cases.
> -   [5G DRIVE](https://5g-drive.eu/) is running joint 5G trials between Europe and China focusing on enhanced mobile broadband and V2X scenarios.
> 
> In addition, our software platform [Orchestra Cities](https://www.orchestracities.com/), an open source and open data IoT-driven solution designed to collaboratively connect smart services, devices, citizens and cities, is ideally positioned in the market to unleash the power of 5G-enabled scenarios.
