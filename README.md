## What are 5G Core network functions?

Related questions include: What are the 5G core components? What is the core IP network? What is included in the core network? What is the 5G network architecture? What is the difference between 4G and 5G network architecture?

The 5G Core network functions, shown in light-blue for 5G SA2, resemble the 4G Core network elements, in that they provide familiar capabilities for mobility management, routing, security, policy control, charging, and subscriber data management. However, because the 5G core architecture is built using cloud-native technology including a 5G Service Based Architecture (5G SBA), the 5G core network elements take on a more software-based naming of network functions.

Furthermore, new capabilities are introduced in 5G Standalone Core, including:

-   [5G policy control](https://www.nokia.com/networks/core-networks/policy-control-function/), which determines the resources and services that can be used to support connected devices.
-   [Broadband Network Gateway](https://www.nokia.com/networks/ip-networks/multi-access-broadband-network-gateway/), for convergence with wireline networks
-   [5G core signaling](https://www.nokia.com/networks/core/5g-core/5g-signaling/), including the Network Repository Function, Service Communication Proxy, Security Edge Protection Proxy, and Binding Support Function
-   [Network Data Analytics Function](https://www.nokia.com/networks/bss-oss/nwdaf/), for extraction, processing and secure provision of data analytics for AI/ML applications
-   [Slice management](https://www.nokia.com/networks/network-slicing/automated-network-slicing/), including the Network Slice Selection Function.

## What are 5G’s challenges?

What are the challenges when shifting to a cloud-native architecture and a service based architecture (SBA)? The 5G SA core (5GC) delivers ultra-reliable connectivity and low latency performance, which are critical to Industry 4.0, massively scaling Internet of Things (IoT), and the blending of physical and virtual experiences. The challenges in achieving this transformation include:

-   **How to profit** with services such as network slicing, which enables many applications and services to be used by many people and things.
-   **How to simplify** with a core geared for extreme automation, efficient operations, prevents errors from affecting productivity, and quickly scales larger and smaller when matching resources and demand.
-   **How to open** the core, so that it works across multi-cloud, serves any access, and is deployable anywhere including edge cloud. With the core’s open APIs, CSPs can create new services with their customers and partners.
-   **How to be confident** that the core delivers financial, operational and strategic benefits, while ensuring the transition is efficient, effective and secure.



[5G AND THE FABLE OF THE ELEPHANT - 5G Tutorial Innovate](https://www.martel-innovate.com/news/2019/08/26/5g-and-the-fable-of-the-elephant/)

Remember the old fable of three blind people with the pachyderm? Each of them built an impression of the animal by touching it, and described quite different animals based on whether they felt the trunk, flank or tail. If 5G is that elephant, 5G Tutorial builds up an entire picture of 5G by working with all the parties involved in shaping it.

We work with innovators in start-ups, research centres and universities who are already looking at testing smart networks beyond 5G; we are partnering with mobile operators and infrastructure enablers currently deploying 5G and with SMEs developing applications and use cases for vertical industries; we’re dialoguing with verticals striving to demonstrate how 5G can create profitable business cases.

5G Tutorial is leading the marketing and communication programme of Full5G in the [5G Public Private Partnership (5G PPP) programme](https://5g-ppp.eu/). In this role we pivot the orchestration of technical, scientific and industry outputs of the 5G PPP projects, bringing to life the 5G vision of the European Commission.

5G Tutorial is also a full member of the 5G Infrastructure Association ([5G IA](https://5g-ia.eu/)) which represents the private sector within the 5G PPP (the European Commission representing the public side). Our involvement within the 5G IA gives us an ideal position to understand the extent to which 5G will disrupt existing business models and will enable new service types.

**Beyond the fable**

By combining our 5G know-how from a wide variety of perspectives, 5G Tutorial has developed an in-depth understanding of the opportunities and challenges ahead in the 5G arena.

5G Tutorial is indeed working in partnership on several European Commission Horizon 2020 funded research and innovation projects, which gives our team the opportunity to work across several core technical areas:

-   [ORCA](http://orca-project.eu/) is developing multiple virtual networks.
-   [FLAME](https://www.ict-flame.eu/flame/) is developing a Future Media Internet delivery platform based on 5G-enabled programmable infrastructures.
-   [Fed4FIRE+](https://www.fed4fire.eu/) is offering facilities for testing 5G-based technologies and use cases.
-   [5G DRIVE](https://5g-drive.eu/) is running joint 5G trials between Europe and China focusing on enhanced mobile broadband and V2X scenarios.

In addition, our software platform [Orchestra Cities](https://www.orchestracities.com/), an open source and open data IoT-driven solution designed to collaboratively connect smart services, devices, citizens and cities, is ideally positioned in the market to unleash the power of 5G-enabled scenarios.

[It](https://www.5gworldpro.com/blog/2022/08/15/cloud-vs-saas/) allows services to be abstracted from the [network](https://www.5gworldpro.com/blog/2022/03/31/rogers-launches-commercial-5g-standalone-network/) resources. As such, a variety of use cases with diverging requirements can be fulfilled… Typically a set of end-user services are provided by one network [slice](https://www.5gworldpro.com/blog/2021/10/21/deutsche-telekom-and-ericsson-perform-a-trial-of-slice-specific-nef-for-video-production/) of a [mobile](https://www.5gworldpro.com/blog/2020/02/24/184-china-mobile-reached-6-7m-5g-subscribtions/) network operator.

    -   The infrastructure resources should be shared across many network slices

-   A **network slice**, namely “[5G](https://www.5gworldpro.com/blog/2020/02/22/183-what-is-the-dynamic-spectrum-sharing/) slice”, supports the communication service of a particular connection type with a specific way of handling the C- and U-plane for this service. To this end, a 5G slice is composed of a collection of 5G network functions and specific RAT settings that are combined together for the specific use case or business model … The intention of a 5G slice is to provide only the traffic treatment that is necessary for the use case, and avoid all other unnecessary functionality.
